   pair: FAQ fundamentals; What is architecture of LeoFS?

What is architecture of LeoFS?
------------------------------

We've been mainly focusing on **High Availability**, **High Scalability** and **High Cost Performance Ratio** since unstructured data such as images, movies and logs have been exponentially increasing day by day, and we needed to build a cloud storage that can handle all them.

LeoFS consists of 3 core components - `LeoFS Gateway <leofs-gateway-detail.html>`_, `Storage <leofs-storage-detail.html>`_ and `Manager <leofs-manager-detail.html>`_. The role of each component is clearly defined.

`LeoFS Gateway <leofs-gateway-detail.html>`_ handles http-requests and http-responses from clients when using REST-API OR S3-API. Also, it has the built-in object-cache system.

`LeoFS Storage <leofs-storage-detail.html>`_ handles *GET*, *PUT* and *DELETE*, Also it has replicator and recoverer in order to keep running and consistency.

`LeoFS Manager <leofs-manager-detail.html>`_ always monitors Gateway(s) and Storage(s). Manger monitors node-status and RING(logical routing-table) checksum to keep running and consistency.


Also, what we payed attention when we desined LeoFS are the following 3 things:
    * To keep always running and No |SPOF|
    * To keep high-performance, regardless of the kind and amount of data
    * To provide easy administration, we already provide LeoFS CUI and GUI console.

Is there the roadmap of LeoFS?
------------------------------

We've published LeoFS milestones on both of |GitHub| and `LeoFS website <milestone.html>`_. We may revise the milestones occasionally because there is a possibility to add new features or change priority of implementation. We'll keep them always updated.
